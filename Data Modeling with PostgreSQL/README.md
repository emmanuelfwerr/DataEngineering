# Data Modeling with PostgreSQL

## Project Datasets
### Song Dataset
The first dataset is a subset of real data from the "Million Song Dataset". Each file is in JSON format and contains metadata about a song and the artist of that song. The files are partitioned by the first three letters of each song's track ID.

### Log Dataset
The second dataset consists of log files in JSON format generated by an event simulator based on the songs in the dataset above. These simulate activity logs from a music streaming app based on specified configurations. The log files in this dataset are partitioned by year and month.
