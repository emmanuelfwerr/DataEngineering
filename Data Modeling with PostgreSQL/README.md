# Data Modeling with PostgreSQL
A startup called Sparkify wants to analyze the data they've been collecting on songs and user activity on their new music streaming app. The analytics team is particularly interested in understanding what songs users are listening to. Currently, they don't have an easy way to query their data, which resides in a directory of JSON logs on user activity on the app, as well as a directory with JSON metadata on the songs in their app.

They'd like a data engineer to create a Postgres database with tables designed to optimize queries on song play analysis, and bring me on the project. My role is to create a database schema and ETL pipeline for this analysis. I'll be able to test my database and ETL pipeline by running queries given to me by the analytics team from Sparkify and compare my results with their expected results.

## Project Datasets
### Song Dataset
The first dataset is a subset of real data from the "Million Song Dataset". Each file is in JSON format and contains metadata about a song and the artist of that song. The files are partitioned by the first three letters of each song's track ID.

### Log Dataset
The second dataset consists of log files in JSON format generated by an event simulator based on the songs in the dataset above. These simulate activity logs from a music streaming app based on specified configurations. The log files in this dataset are partitioned by year and month.
